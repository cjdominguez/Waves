# Description: 
Waves(Surfer bro) is the ultimate 2D game. Assist our Surfer Character (Mark Zuckenberg) to ride the waves and collect more than 20 coins in order to win the game. 
Waves (Surfer Bro) it is part of a python programming class at Saint Leo University. This project was created by python students in order to develop their abilities on programming and have a learning experience on how to code, test, and develop games.

# Installation: 
Download the zip file with the game waves.py and the sprite .png files (mark1.png and plane1.png) and the music file (alexander-nakarada-chase.mp3) and place it on your python IDLE location. All files have to be in the same directory.
Run the code on the Python IDLE, and enjoy the game!

# Usage:

## Directional Keys: 

Up – surfer moves up the screen, when key released, surfer falls down with gravity. When surfer reaches top of screen, he stays on screen. Screen does not scroll down.

Down – surfer moves down the screen, when key released, surfer continues down with gravity. When surfer reaches bottom of screen, he stays on screen. Screen does not scroll up.

Right – surfer moves to right. When surfer crosses 25% of the screen, scrolling begins. When surfer reaches a marginal point on the right, the screen scroll speed matches the speed of the surfer, so the surfer stays on the screen.

Left – surfer moves to the left.  If surfer touches the left side of the screen, Game Over.  If surfer stops on the screen while scroll if on and is brought to the left side of the screen, Game Over.
